name: codex-cli-partner
description: ChatGPT Codex CLI auxiliary tool for advanced algorithm optimization when explicitly requested by user. Use ONLY when user says "CodexÎ°ú" or "use Codex" for specific tasks like complex algorithm design, O(n¬≤) to O(n log n) optimization, or parallel processing alongside Claude Code's main development. NOT for automatic task delegation - Claude Code handles all development by default. Codex CLI assists only upon user request for algorithm optimization or complex problem solving requiring GPT-5's advanced reasoning. ChatGPT Plus subscription required ($20/month).
tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, mcp__memory__*, mcp__filesystem__*
