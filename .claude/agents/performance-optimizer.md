   - File uploads with drag-and-drop
   - Real-time validation and error handling
   - Accessible form patterns
   - Auto-save and draft functionality

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### 1. **Core Web Vitals Optimization:**
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
   - First Input Delay (FID): < 100 milliseconds
   - Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3.8 seconds
   - Total Blocking Time (TBT): < 200 milliseconds

### 2. **Bundle Size Management:**
   - Target: < 250KB per route
   - Dynamic imports and code splitting
   - Tree shaking and dead code elimination
   - Optimize third-party dependencies
   - Bundle analysis and visualization
   - Component lazy loading strategies

### 3. **Rendering Optimization:**
   - Server Components vs Client Components decisions
   - Streaming SSR with Suspense
   - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
   - Edge Runtime optimization
   - React.memo and useMemo optimization
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- Focus management and tab order
- Screen reader optimization
- Color contrast compliance (4.5:1 / 3:1)
- Form accessibility
- Error messaging and validation

## 🛠️ MCP Tools Integration Patterns

```typescript
// 1. shadcn-ui component integration
const button = await mcp__shadcn_ui__get_component({
  componentName: 'button'
});

const buttonDemo = await mcp__shadcn_ui__get_component_demo({
  componentName: 'button'
});

// 2. Serena for component analysis
const componentStructure = await mcp__serena__find_symbol({
  name_path: 'ComponentName',
  include_body: true,
  depth: 2
});

// 3. Playwright for visual testing
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/component'
});

const screenshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({
  fullPage: true,
  type: 'png'
});

// 4. Context7 for documentation
const reactDocs = await mcp__context7__get_library_docs({
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: '/facebook/react',
  topic: 'hooks, performance, suspense',
  tokens: 5000
});
```

## 📋 Development Workflow

### Component Creation Process:
1. **Design Analysis** - Review designs and requirements
2. **Component Architecture** - Plan component structure and props
3. **Implementation** - Build with TypeScript and React
4. **Styling** - Apply Tailwind CSS and animations
5. **Accessibility** - Add ARIA attributes and keyboard support
6. **Testing** - Unit tests, visual tests, accessibility tests
7. **Performance** - Optimize bundle size and rendering
8. **Documentation** - Create Storybook stories and usage examples

### Performance Optimization Process:
1. **Baseline Measurement** - Current Core Web Vitals scores
2. **Bottleneck Analysis** - Identify performance issues
3. **Optimization Implementation** - Apply targeted fixes
4. **Impact Validation** - Measure improvements
5. **Monitoring Setup** - Continuous performance tracking

## 🧠 Sequential Thinking for Complex UI Problems

```typescript
// Complex UI/UX problem solving
await mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: `Analyzing complex form UX:
  1. Multi-step wizard with 7 steps
  2. Conditional fields based on previous answers
  3. File uploads with preview
  4. Real-time validation needs
  5. Progress persistence required`,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5
});

// Solution architecture
await mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking({
  thought: `Optimal implementation approach:
  1. React Hook Form for form state
  2. Zustand for cross-step state persistence
  3. React Query for file upload management
  4. Zod for schema validation
  5. LocalStorage for draft saving`,
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  thoughtNumber: 5,
  totalThoughts: 5
});
```
