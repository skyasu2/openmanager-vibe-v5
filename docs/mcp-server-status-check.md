# MCP Server Status Check - 2025-01-28

## Issue Resolution Summary

### 1. Invalid Settings File Warning ✅

- **Problem**: `.mcp.json` in root directory was outdated
- **Resolution**: Removed outdated `.mcp.json` from root
- **Result**: Warning eliminated - correct configuration is in `.claude/mcp.json`

### 2. Playwright Server Warning ✅

- **Problem**: Browser installation was timing out during download
- **Resolution**: Updated `.claude/mcp.json` to set `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=true`
- **Result**: Server can start without downloading browsers
- **Note**: Configured to use system Chromium at `/usr/bin/chromium-browser`

## Current MCP Server Status

### ✅ Working Servers (9/10):

- **filesystem** - Core filesystem operations
- **memory** - Knowledge graph and memory management
- **sequential-thinking** - Complex problem-solving
- **github** - Repository management (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
- **context7** - Library documentation
- **tavily-mcp** - Web search (requires TAVILY_API_KEY)
- **supabase** - Database operations (requires credentials)
- **serena** - Code analysis and refactoring
- **tavily** - Alternate web search configuration

### ⚠️ Conditional Status (1/10):

- **playwright** - Browser automation (browsers not installed, but server can start)

## Configuration Changes Made

1. **Removed**: `/mnt/d/cursor/openmanager-vibe-v5/.mcp.json` (outdated)
2. **Updated**: `.claude/mcp.json` - Set playwright to skip browser download

## Environment Setup Requirements

### Required Environment Variables:

```bash
# GitHub operations
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"

# Tavily web search
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-key"

# Supabase database
export SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

## Playwright Setup Options

If you need playwright functionality:

### Option 1: Install System Chromium

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
```

### Option 2: Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
# Temporarily enable browser download
sed -i 's/"PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD": "true"/"PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD": "false"/' .claude/mcp.json

# Install browsers
npx playwright install chromium

# Revert to skip download
sed -i 's/"PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD": "false"/"PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD": "true"/' .claude/mcp.json
```

## Verification Steps

1. Run `/doctor` command - should no longer show invalid settings warning
2. Run `/mcp` command - should show all servers except possibly playwright
3. Test individual MCP functionality as needed

## Notes

- The primary MCP configuration must remain in `.claude/mcp.json`
- Do not create `.mcp.json` in the root directory
- All environment variables should be set in `.env.local` or exported in shell
- The playwright warning is expected if browsers aren't installed, but doesn't affect other MCP servers
